## Overview
### Scenario

SBA : TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript

In this assessment, you will apply the skills you’ve developed throughout the TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript module to build a functional, real-world application. This project will test your understanding of TypeScript features, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, asynchronous operations, error handling, and API interaction. You will have 5.5 hours to complete this assessment.

You will create an E-commerce Product Management System using TypeScript. The final deliverable will include a GitHub repository with your project and a written reflection on your approach and the challenges you faced.

## Built with

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- npm/npx
- tsc

## Configuration and Dependancies

1. Build the TypeScript Files

Compiles all .ts files into /dist:

npm run build


This runs: tsc --project tsconfig.json

2. Run the Compiled JavaScript

After building, run the app from the dist folder:

npm start

## Reflection

Write a reflection of roughly 300 words addressing:
 - How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.
 - The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
 - How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.

 I implemented TypeScript and OOP principles in a clear, straightforward way, using classes, interfaces, and strong typing to keep the structure organized. The project was smooth, and I didn’t encounter major challenges. Asynchronous operations were handled with simple async/await patterns, keeping the logic readable and predictable. For errors, I used basic try/catch blocks and practical checks to prevent issues before they occurred. Overall, the project was easy to build, and it strengthened my understanding of TypeScript, OOP design, and asynchronous programming.

 Stretch goal: add a UI to visualize data and interactions.
 Update(11/23/25) : Added basic UI 
  - would add load more functionality


Note for Grading: 
  - lines 24-26 are for duplicate from index.ts for html
  - and index.ts is commented out
